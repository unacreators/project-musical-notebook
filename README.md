# MusicalNoteBook Flutter Project Instructions

## Project Overview

Create a new Flutter project for `MusicalNoteBook`. The goal is to build an application that allows users to create and manage notes, with the added feature of playing random sounds when typing on specific keys.

### Project Assets

- Check the attached directory named `sounds` for seven musical notes.
- Use the image `keyboard.jpg` for reference, which shows the second bottom row keys.

### Project Setup

1. Create a new Flutter project with a suitable name.
2. Apply a matching icon for the Flutter app, either by creating one or using online tools like Canva, Icons8, or Figma.

## User Functionality

1. Users should be able to create and store notes locally on the device or in an online database of your choice.
2. Implement functionality to manage notes, including viewing a list of created notes, editing, and deleting them.

## Sound Integration

1. Generate or assign random sounds from the `sounds` directory to play when the user types on specific keys.
2. Users should be able to enable/disable sound while typing in the note.
3. Sounds should play only on alphanumeric key presses (A-Z, 0-9).
4. Do not play sounds on space and any other key presses.
5. The keyboard's second bottom row ([See Keyboard Image](keyboard.jpg)) keys `Z`, `X`, `C`, `V`, `B`, `N`, and `M` should always produce linear sounds (`note1` to `note7`).
6. The number keys (1-7) should also correspond to playing `note1` to `note7`.

## User Interface (UI)

1. Design the UI according to your imagination.
2. Consider wire-framing the UI using pen and paper or online tools like Figma for better visualization.

## Submission Requirements

1. Push the code to a publicly accessible GitHub repository.
2. Share the link to the GitHub repository.
3. Create an APK of the app and share the download link.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Code Quality and Coding Standards.
2. Applied Logic and Correctness of Code.
3. Basic Functionality of the App.
4. Performance of the App.
5. App UI and UX.

**Note:** The design of the UI is at your discretion; however, ensure it is user-friendly and enhances the overall user experience.
